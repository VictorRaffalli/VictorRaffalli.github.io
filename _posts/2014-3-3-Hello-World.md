### "The Interesting Answer" 

Susan Sontag once said “The only interesting answers are those which destroy the questions” so I will try to answer a difficult question: what is art? Throughout history, art has been a vehicle for capturing human emotions and immortalizing epochs, but the concept is not completely clear. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines art as “skill acquired by experience, study or observation” but that doesn’t encompass what art really means for us.

My uncle considers his attempt at Ramen to be art, and since he is a lazy reader, I can use this safe space to guarantee you it is not. Can food be art, though? Art is commonly used to describe what has been done with passion, for example: a football player might refer to his sport as art, but that is a distortion of the term to romanticize their job, art is fundamentally not based on competition, while sports are. This hypothetical footballer is as confused about the term as my uncle. Not everything that is pleasant to us should be regarded as art, this doesn’t mean that football is less worthy of admiration than a painting, though.

Films are one of the newest forms of art, they have become a window in time through which we can glance at yesterday and see what the world was like in a particular year since the 1900s. This is another requirement that art must meet to be considered as such: it lasts in time. A kid from Cambodia can watch the movie “Up” and shed the same tears that a grown man in Nebraska shedded while watching it, which speaks about the human connection that is embedded in art, but not in other human activities. You don’t have to explain art, it either moves you or not. This is not the case with sports, where you do have to understand a set of rules so the game can trigger powerful emotions.

 These are characteristics that narrow the definition of art: it is universal, it lasts in time, and it has the ability to make an emotional impact without explanations. To my uncle’s credit, Ramen can fulfill said requirements. Even though I dislike the one he cooks, his recipe is his reinterpretation of asian cuisine, which is the product of millions of human minds working together to improve the flavors of our daily meals. Asian food is universal, it is enjoyed by billions of people all over the world, you don’t have to explain Ramen to someone for them to be delighted by it, and  the recipe to cook Ramen has lasted in time. So can we argue that food is art? certainly. When I asked myself this question is that I realized something: I was never going to destroy my question with an answer, like Susan Sontag would want me to, I was going to destroy Susan Sontag’s premise: an interesting answer is not one which destroys all questions, an interesting answer is one which turns one question into a deeper one.

### The Remote Tower Project. 

Do you know why airplanes are the safest means of transportation? 

One of the main reasons is due to air traffic services, but still, there are challenging realities that air traffic services face: there is frequently a mismatch between demand and resources which leads to disadvantageous cost efficiency and lower service level. 

Sometimes there is high demand for air traffic services but the airport is lacking air traffic officers, take weekends and holidays as an example; other times, at small airports, officers are often underutilized due to the low number of flights. This mismatch comes with multiple negative consequences in terms of safety and quality of service. 

But how could these challenges be overcome? could we balance every officer’s workload and make air traffic services more efficient?

That’s exactly what The Remote Tower Project is achieving with a forward thinking tech approach. 

The Remote Tower Project replaces the control tower’s out of the window view with a high definition video panorama and a pan tilt zoom camera, which are smarter tools than today’s binoculars. 

This video stream is relayed and displayed at any location you choose. Preferably at a remote tower center where you connect several airports, which are operated from a pool of air traffic officers, providing their services to airports where it is needed. This way one officer is able to provide their services to multiple airports at the same time. 

The remote tower concept solves a realm of difficulties that need to be dealt with, not only it eases the officer’s workflow since no officer will be underutilized or overwhelmed with tasks, but it also has advantages like helping Air Navigation Service Providers increase their cost-efficiency. 

The Remote Tower Project presents a modern and sophisticated solution to our limited capability of managing resources efficiently, ultimately leading to safer air space travel.

### CDF-LU 

**Voice Over:** Rockets and satellites inspire the kid in all of us.

**Visuals:** A rocket and a satellite are shown in space. We zoom out to realize that this scene was being played on a tablet held by a little girl. The girl is standing next to the window of her room (with a toy rocket next to it). She is initially looking at the tablet, but then looks up through the window into the star-studded night.

**Voice Over:** But designing them is complex. Let’s have a look.

**Visuals:** The rocket and satellite jump out from the tablet and everything else disappears. We see graphs and complex measurements around them to convey their complexity.

**Voice Over:** The very first step is to develop the concepts that become technologies and systems required for space missions of the future. 

**Visuals:** We see a female engineer (the adult version of the above little girl) sitting at her work desk (on it we see the same toy rocket from the first scene), tapping a pencil against her mouth, deep in thought. After a little while she starts writing on a piece of paper.

**Voice Over:** This involves teams of specialists from a variety of disciplines, to develop a perfectly synchronised solution.

**Visuals:** We see a close up of the piece of paper with the hand of our female character drawing the outline of a rocket on it. A little afterwards, two more hands come into the scene sliding in two additional pieces of paper with annotations on them. Eventually the hands slide away with the three pieces of paper. Finally our female character’s hand comes back into the scene sliding in a blueprint of the rocket she was sketching earlier (visual reference: 1:06 of this video).

**Voice Over:** This is a crucial phase and making the wrong decision here can mean the failure of the whole program. This ideation phase influences 80% of the life cycle cost.

**Visuals:** The rocket from the blueprint gets converted to a real rocket on a launching pad. We see a countdown but instead of successfully taking off, it fails. The caption: “80% of life cycle cost” is shown in the middle of the screen in sync with the voiceover.

**Voice Over:** Traditionally, the design of space systems is done sequentially. This is a time-consuming process where the exchange of information is slow and inefficient.

**Visuals:** We see a small part of a rocket being designed on a computer monitor. A little afterwards, we see how this design is sent via email. The camera pans to the right and we see another computer monitor receiving the first design via email. We see how a second part of the rocket is designed next to the first one, and again it all gets sent via email. Before the scene is over, the camera starts panning to the right again to convey the continuation of this sequential process.

**Voice Over:** A modern design approach instead uses simultaneous processing and integration of multidisciplinary design. This is the concurrent engineering approach.

**Visuals:** We replicate the start of the previous scene (i.e. a small part of a rocket being designed on a computer monitor). This time though, we zoom out to see several similar computer monitors in a circle configuration, all connected to a central digital blackboard. We slowly zoom into the digital blackboard, in which there are several parts of the rocket all being designed concurrently. We see some designs getting integrated with other designs.

**Voice Over:** By enabling a team on a project to make decisions in real-time, designs for new space systems are more accurate, delivered on shorter timelines, and costs are reduced.

**Visuals:** As the concurrent design process continues, we see right in the middle of the digital blackboard how all the individual designs contribute progressively to build the rocket as a whole.

**Voice Over:** The recently developed Concurrent Design Facility at the University of Luxembourg, CDF-LU, is a state-of-the-art environment where concurrent engineering is practiced to design systems and technologies for future space missions.

**Visuals:** We zoom out of the digital blackboard and around it we now see a (2D) representation of the lab. The LU logo is shown in sync with the narration of “CDF-LU”.

**Voice Over:** At CDF-LU we are developing a broad portfolio of capabilities, to apply them in a diverse range of applications, including satellites, rockets and other space systems.

**Visuals:** An animated matrix appears consisting of capabilities (at the mention of the word “capability” in the audio) in rows and applications  (at the mention of the word “application” in the audio) in columns. The intersection of a capability with an application creates a new configuration (note: the CDF-LU can change to that configuration, this is why CDF-LU is later explained as being modular and flexible). Each capability and application is shown with a representative icon next to it. At the mention of “satellites” we start showing ‘CDF Config-1’ (see the next scene).

Here is the full list of capabilities and applications (the text inside brackets is not to be shown in the video):

Capabilities:

1.Conceptual Design
2.Feasibility Studies
3.Product Life-Cycle Planning
4.Reverse Engineering
5.Multi-Disciplinary Optimization
6.Requirement Engineering
7.Knowledge-base Engineering
8.Mission Operations
9.Mission Architecture
10.Strategic Forecasting Studies
11.Strategy Development
12.Applications:
13.Subsystem Technologies (Propulsion, Communication, Power, et al)
14.Satellites (Cubesats, Satellite Swarm, Distributed Satellite System)
15.Launch Vehicles / Rockets (Earth-to-Space)
16.Reentry Systems (Space-to-Earth)
17.Interplanetary Transport (LEO-to-Moon Orbit, Earth-Mars)
18.Landers (Lunar/Mars Lander, Moon/Mars-Orbit to Surface)
19.Extraterrestrial Mobility Vehicles (Rovers, Drones)
20.Space Architectures (Mars Colony, Moon Village)

**Voice Over:** The distinguishing feature of CDF-LU is its flexibility. The lab has a modular configuration as it adapts the capability uniquely to an individual application.

**Visuals:** We show different participants i.e. scientists (in lab coats), engineers in a different attire, policy experts in suits, etc.

In the portfolio matrix, we show how the intersection of a capability and application denotes a different configuration of the CDF-LU. The configuration means how the participating members and workstations change in the CDF-LU.

We now continue from the animated matrix and show 2 configurations of the lab described below at the intersection of the capability and application.

Configurations to be shown:

CDF Config-1 -- Satellite Design:

Intersection of the (Application = Satellite) and (Capability = Concept Design).
Participating members = Engineers (System Engineering + Thermal Subsystem + Communications Subsystem + …).

CDF Config-2 – Space Architecture Planning:

Intersection of the (Application = Space Architectures) and (Capability = Product Life-Cycle Planning).
Participating members = Mixed (Policy Experts + Scientists + Space System Engineers + Architecture Engineers).

**Voice Over:** The CDF-LU is an innovative platform for materialising new ideas in space system design, from technology feasibility and spacecraft design to space architecture planning.

**Visuals:** Compared to a sophisticated swiss army knife, it can become a different tool (capability) for each different purpose (application). Visual reference (replacing the icons with concepts representing the different capabilities listed above).

The swiss army visual is to be followed by the animation of these three capability examples mentioned in the voiceover:

1. technology feasibility (showing designing a piece of electronic equipment like an antenna/solar panel or a rocket engine).

2. spacecraft design (zoom out of the engine/antenna to show the whole rocket and satellite).

3. space architecture planning (show a colony on the moon where the rocket is launching from the moon, satellite in the orbit communicating with the base etc.).

This shows the application of the CDF at different and increasing levels. Level 3 is made of things at level 2 which is made of things at level 1.
At each level visual, we show the CDF swiss army knife with that capability icon extended out and other capability icons folded in.

**Voice Over:** At the CDF-LU all these elements come together to get us that much closer... to realising the next big idea in space!

**Visuals:** We come back to the rocket on a launching pad that failed to take off in an earlier scene, and this time it takes off successfully.
The video finishes by showing an animation of this image, with the white SnT logo building up in the middle of the screen, and on the left bottom corner the university logo in a white box.
