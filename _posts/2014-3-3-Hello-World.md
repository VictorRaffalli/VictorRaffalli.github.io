### "The Interesting Answer" 

Susan Sontag once said “The only interesting answers are those which destroy the questions” so I will try to answer a difficult question: what is art? Throughout history, art has been a vehicle for capturing human emotions and immortalizing epochs, but the concept is not completely clear. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines art as “skill acquired by experience, study or observation” but that doesn’t encompass what art really means for us.

My uncle considers his attempt at Ramen to be art, and since he is a lazy reader, I can use this safe space to guarantee you it is not. Can food be art, though? Art is commonly used to describe what has been done with passion, for example: a football player might refer to his sport as art, but that is a distortion of the term to romanticize their job, art is fundamentally not based on competition, while sports are. This hypothetical footballer is as confused about the term as my uncle. Not everything that is pleasant to us should be regarded as art, this doesn’t mean that football is less worthy of admiration than a painting, though.

Films are one of the newest forms of art, they have become a window in time through which we can glance at yesterday and see what the world was like in a particular year since the 1900s. This is another requirement that art must meet to be considered as such: it lasts in time. A kid from Cambodia can watch the movie “Up” and shed the same tears that a grown man in Nebraska shedded while watching it, which speaks about the human connection that is embedded in art, but not in other human activities. You don’t have to explain art, it either moves you or not. This is not the case with sports, where you do have to understand a set of rules so the game can trigger powerful emotions.

 These are characteristics that narrow the definition of art: it is universal, it lasts in time, and it has the ability to make an emotional impact without explanations. To my uncle’s credit, Ramen can fulfill said requirements. Even though I dislike the one he cooks, his recipe is his reinterpretation of asian cuisine, which is the product of millions of human minds working together to improve the flavors of our daily meals. Asian food is universal, it is enjoyed by billions of people all over the world, you don’t have to explain Ramen to someone for them to be delighted by it, and  the recipe to cook Ramen has lasted in time. So can we argue that food is art? certainly. When I asked myself this question is that I realized something: I was never going to destroy my question with an answer, like Susan Sontag would want me to, I was going to destroy Susan Sontag’s premise: an interesting answer is not one which destroys all questions, an interesting answer is one which turns one question into a deeper one.
