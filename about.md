I am a creative and technical writer from Venezuela, currently based in Barcelona, Spain. 

### More Information

My biggest passions are writing and technology. My ultimate goal is to keep improving my writing skills and cultivate my technology knowledge so I can be a usefool tool in collaborative projects. I am far from being a software engineer, but as long as I can use my skillset to contribute to projects related to software development, artificial intelligence, and  science, I will be fulfilled.
